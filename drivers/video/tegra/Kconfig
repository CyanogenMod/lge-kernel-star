	  This driver implements a dummy framebuffer device for systems based
	  on the NVIDIA Tegra family of SoCs. Display initialization is
	  expected to happen prior to the kernel start-up for this driver to
	  function.

	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support the /dev/nvmap device. This device
	  is used by NVIDIA Tegra graphics and multimedia drivers for managing
	  graphics memory.

config DEVNVMAP_PARANOID
	bool "Validate all user-provided /dev/nvmap object references"
	depends on DEVNVMAP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to enable additional process-level validations and
	  permissions for /dev/nvmap object references provided via ioctls.
	  May result in a decrease in performance.

	bool "Allow /dev/nvmap to reclaim unpinned I/O virtual memory"
	depends on DEVNVMAP && TEGRA_IOVMM
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable /dev/nvmap to reclaim I/O virtual memory after
	  it has been unpinned, and re-use it for other objects. This can
	  allow a larger virtual I/O VM space than would normally be
	  supported by the hardware, at a slight cost in performance.

config NVMAP_CARVEOUT_KILLER
	bool "Reclaim nvmap carveout by killing processes"
	depends on DEVNVMAP
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to allow the system to reclaim carveout space by killing
	  processes. This will kill the largest consumers of lowest priority
	  first.
