ramzswap: Compressed RAM based swap device
-------------------------------------------

Project home: http://compcache.googlecode.com/

* Introduction
The ramzswap module creates RAM based block devices which can (only) be used as
swap disks. Pages swapped to these devices are compressed and stored in memory
itself. See project home for use cases, performance numbers and a lot more.

* Compiling
  - 'make':	This will compile all modules against your kernel
  - 'make doc':	This will compile rzscontrol manual page:
		sub-projects/rzscontrol/man/rzscontrol.1
  - Optional (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED):
	- Apply the patch found in compcache/patches/ directory and just
	  compile the kernel as usual. Currently, the patch is against 2.6.33
	  but it should apply to slightly older kernels too. This will enable
	  'swap free notify' feature which allows kernel to send callback to
	  ramzswap as soon as a swap slot becomes free. So, we can immediately
	  free memory allocated for this page, eliminating any stale data in
	  (compressed) memory.
	- Uncomment '#define CONFIG_SWAP_FREE_NOTIFY' in compcache/compat.h
	  before compiling compcache against this patched kernel. Otherwise,
          this swap notify callback will not be used.

Following binaries are created:
  - ramzswap.ko (kernel driver)
  - sub-projects/rzscontrol/rzscontrol (userspace tool)

* Using
Following shows a typical sequence of steps for using ramzswap.

  1) Load Modules:
     # load dependency modules
     modprobe lzo_compress
     modprobe lzo_decompress

     # example1: load ramzswap module
     insmod ramzswap.ko num_devices=4

     This creates 4 devices (/dev/ramzswap{0,1,2,3}) which are left
     uninitialized.

     # example2: load ramzswap module and initialize the first device
     insmod ramzswap.ko num_devices=4 disksize_kb=20480

     This initializes first device (/dev/ramzswap0) with disksize of 20MB.
     Other 3 devices (/dev/ramzswap{1,2,3}) are left uninitialized.

  2) Initialize:
     Use rzscontrol utility to configure and initialize individual
     ramzswap devices. Example:
        rzscontrol /dev/ramzswap0 --init # uses default value of disksize_kb

     *See rzscontrol manpage for more details and examples*

  3) Activate:
     swapon /dev/ramzswap2 # or any other initialized ramzswap device

  4) Stats:
     rzscontrol /dev/ramzswap2 --stats

  5) Deactivate:
     swapoff /dev/ramzswap2

  6) Reset:
     rzscontrol /dev/ramzswap2 --reset

  7) Unload Modules:
     rmmod ramzswap
     rmmod lzo_compress
     rmmod lzo_decompress

* Common Problems
  - If you get lots of compiler errors, make sure you have the package for
    kernel source installed. For e.g., on Fedora its 'kernel-devel' package.
